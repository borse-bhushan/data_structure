"""
ðŸ“– Problem Statement:
Given a stream of lowercase characters (one at a time), return a string where each character represents the first non-repeating character in the stream so far.
If no non-repeating character exists at a point, use "#".

ðŸ“¥ Inputs & ðŸ“¤ Outputs:
âœ… Example 1:
Input:  stream = "aabc"
Output: "a#bb"
Explanation:

'a' â†’ first non-repeating = 'a'

'a' â†’ 'a' is repeating â†’ "#"

'b' â†’ 'b' is first non-repeating

'c' â†’ 'b' is still first non-repeating

âœ… Example 2:
Input: stream = "zz"
Output: "z#"
âœ… Example 3:
Input: stream = "abcabc"
Output: "aaa###"
ðŸªœ Steps:

Initialize an empty queue and a count dictionary.
For each character in stream:
Add to queue.
Increment frequency.
While the front of queue is repeating, dequeue.
Append front if available, else "#".
